  <h4 align="center">An Modcharting backend library for Codename Engine made by modders, to modders.</h4>
</p>

**FunkinModchart** is a tool designed to bring [NotITG](https://www.noti.tg/) visuals and capabilities to [Codename Engine](https://codename-engine.com/), adding modifiers to change the **arrow trajectory, colors, transparency and the  rotation angle through 3D Axes**, event system to change the modifier's percent easing or setting those to create endless amazing visual effects and even **more**!.

This framework also provides **extra features** that can help you to make even more crazy visuals, as **arrow paths, 3D view camera, AFTs**, etc. *(If you have already modeled NotITG or StepMania, you know what I am talking about)*

## Credits
